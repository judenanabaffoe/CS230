1. Brief Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements
The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a game development company aiming to expand their popular Android game, Draw It or Lose It, to the web and multiple platforms. Their goal was to enable cross-platform play and provide scalability for future enhancements. The software requirements centered on creating a design for a web-based, distributed multiplayer architecture that could maintain unique game and team names, single-instance game management, and extensible logic for teams and players. The client required secure session control, scalable server hosting, robust memory and storage management, and effective system architecture supporting continued growth.
\2. What Did You Do Particularly Well?
I excelled at creating a clear and organized software design document. The structure followed industry standards, including sections on requirements, constraints, domain modeling, system architecture, and evaluation of platform choices. I developed UML diagrams and tables to visualize program components and workflow. My documentation clearly communicated design patterns like Singleton for game instance control and Iterator for unique naming validation, ensuring both maintainability and extensibility for the development team.
3. What Was Helpful During the Design Document Process?
Working through the design document helped me think critically about architectural decisions before coding. By mapping out classes, relationships, and requirements, I could anticipate where patterns (like Singleton and Iterator) would be necessary and avoid pitfalls such as duplicate entities or memory management issues. The evaluation of operating system platforms and development tools also helped clarify deployment, testing, and infrastructure requirements ahead of time, which saved time during implementation.
4. What Would You Revise and How Would You Improve It?
If I could revise one part of the documentation, I would include more detailed API specifications and example user flows. While the architecture and class relationships were clear, adding RESTful API endpoints and sample interaction diagrams would strengthen communication with both front-end and back-end developers, making integration smoother and reducing ambiguity about how features should behave.
5. How Did You Interpret and Implement User Needs? Why Is This Important?
I interpreted user needs by translating business and gameplay requirements into technical specifications. For example, ensuring globally unique team names and single game instance management addressed specific gameplay requirements. The design prioritized scalability, security, and future extensibility to align with The Gaming Room's business goals. Considering user needs is crucialâ€”it guarantees that the final product meets expectations, is engaging, remains secure, and is easy to maintain and expand over time.
6. How Did You Approach Designing Software? Future Techniques and Strategies
My approach focused on object-oriented design, leveraging UML diagrams and domain modeling to clarify relationships. I applied design patterns appropriate for the requirements (Singleton, Iterator), and broke down the architecture by separating concerns: storage, memory, distributed networking, and security. In the future, I would use agile-inspired prototyping, incorporate automated testing plans into the design, and iterate more closely with clients and stakeholders to capture new requirements early
